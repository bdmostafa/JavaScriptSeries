Some workflow tools - webpack, gulp, grunt etc.

Webpack is to fix the issues as like huge coding on one file, debugging issue, multiple scripts (single responsibility principal), multiple request handling in index.html file, bandwidth loss, slowing the application

Webpack- module bundler (bundle multiple js file to single file)
https://webpack.js.org/

Main file - main.js/app.js/script.js (anyone)
Dependency file - UI.js, Store.js, weather.js, or any related js file (altogether)

Babel - Convert the latest code into the older version code so that both of old and modern browsers can read the code and execute well

JavaScript compiler - (next generation code to ES5)
https://babeljs.io/
